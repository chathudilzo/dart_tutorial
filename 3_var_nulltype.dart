//In Dart, you can declare a variable using the var keyword. 
//The type of the variable is inferred from the value assigned to it. If you declare a variable without assigning a value to it, it will have a default value of null.

void main(){
  var a;
  print(a);//null
  print(a.runtimeType);//Null
}
